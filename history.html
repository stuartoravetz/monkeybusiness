                        ice cream shop in the Brazil. Their home was surrounded by the rainforest. They were inspired 
                        by the colors in the rainforest. </p>                
                    <p> In 1972, the Jansen's chain was purchased by the Google corporation. The factory was modernized 
                        and the ideas and mixture of flavors were changed to reflect the vision of the new generation</p>
                    <p>Today, you can still find some old favorite flavors mixed in with the newer creations.</p>
